> Exercise 1.7: Consider the following expression:  (x and y and (not z)) or ((not y) and x)  Are the parentheses necessary? Would you recommend their use in that expression?

While the parentheses are not strictly necessary due to Lua's logical operator precedence, I would recommend using them as they enhance the readability and make the logical grouping of the expression clearer to understand.
